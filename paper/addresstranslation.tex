\section{Address translations, linear address space, process address space}
\label{address_translation}

...

On IA32 this information is located in the registers CR3 (control register),
LDTR (local descriptor table register) and GDTR (global descriptor table
register). These tables are then used in a 2-level address translation: The
logical address used by a process, consisting of a segment selector and a
segment offset, is translated via the global and local descriptor tables

...

\subsubsection{Matching via statisticts: NCD (nearest compression distance)}
