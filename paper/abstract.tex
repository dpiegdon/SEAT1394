\section{Abstract}

When accessing memory via physical addressing, one will miss all the features
provided by a CPU to a process that accesses the same memory: all kinds of
address translations, caching and alike. This paper will give an overview
of these problems in general and then, mostly limited to the IA32 architecture
running a linux 2.6 kernel with no more than 4GB RAM and
3GB userspace/1GB kernelspace mapping, discuss these in detail and give some
solutions.
