\begin{abstract}

Several advances in hacking via DMA will be introduced, including stealing ssh
private keys, injecting code and obtaining an interactive shell via firewire
only.

All of these advances are based on data structures that are required by the CPU
to provide virtual address spaces for each process running on the system.  These
data structures are searched and then parsed to solve the puzzle of randomly
scattered pages in the physical memory, thus being able to read and write in
each processes virtual address space.

Most of the attacks introduced will be adaptable to all kinds of operating
system and hardware combinations, but as a sample target, linux on an IA32
system with the kernel-options \texttt{CONFIG\_NOHIGHMEM} or
\texttt{CONFIG\_HIGHMEM4G}, \texttt{CONFIG\_VMSPLIT\_3G} and
\texttt{CONFIG\_PAGE\_OFFSET=0xC0000000} is used.
