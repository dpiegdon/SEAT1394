\section{Abstract}

Accessing memory via physical addressing, one will miss all the addressing- and
memoryfeatures provided by a CPU to a process that accesses the same memory: all
kinds of address translations, caching and alike.

This paper will give an overview of these problems in general and subsequently,
mostly limited to the IA32 architecture running a linux 2.6 kernel with no more
than 4GB RAM (\texttt{CONFIG\_NOHIGHMEM} or \texttt{CONFIG\_HIGHMEM4G}) and 3GB
userspace/1GB kernelspace mapping (\texttt{CONFIG\_VMSPLIT\_3G},
\texttt{CONFIG\_PAGE\_OFFSET=0xC0000000}), discuss these in detail and give some
solutions. \label{ia32_config_options}
