ATTACK:
	kernelspace:
		[kernelspace stack @ 0xf72c9f44]

	userspace:
		processes to overwrite:
			agetty
				contra: stalled in read() :(
				pro: sh forked from agetty considered harmless
				pro: won't be missed, as it respawns if gone
			gpm
				contra: sh forked from gpm considered harmfull
				pro: mostly not needed

				stalled in read?
			cron
				pro: sh forked from cron considered mostly harmless
				contra: lost cron may be missed sooner or later

				not stalled for long (~60 seconds)
			inetd / xinetd
				contra: sh forked from inetd considered harmfull
				contra: lost inetd may be missed sooner or later

				stalled in read?
			portmap
				contra: sh forked from portmap considered harmfull
				contra: lost portmap may be missed sooner or later

				stalled in read?
			syslog
				contra: sh forked from syslog considered harmfull
				contra: lost syslog will be missed

				not stalled for long
