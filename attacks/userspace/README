all these programs will only work, if the target system is an IA32
linux with a 3G1G addresslayout: 3G userspace, 1G kernelspace:
	kernelconfig: 
		!CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G (not tested)
		one of:
			* CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM (will work, not required)
			* CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G (will work, not required)
		CONFIG_VMSPLIT_3G (must have)
		thus CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET = 0xC0000000
		thus PAGE_OFFSET = 0xC0000000

this is a typical config for ia32 desktop, laptop and most server
systems. kernel-2.6.18.1 has been tested. kernel-2.4 has NOT been
tested but should work. other 2.6 kernels should work, as well.

remote-ps.c
	will try to find all processes on a given system that is
	connected via firewire. give the target number as argument. to
	find this number (0...CSR), use e.g. 1394csrtool.


snarf-sshkey.c, ssh-authfile.h
	this will search for ssh-agent processes and dump all private
	keys it can find in an immediately usable format (!).Â again,
	give target number of machine on firewirebus as argument. to
	find target number (0...CSR), use e.g. 1394csrtool.

	as second parameter, -t may be given to test the obtained keys
	on validity on the fly. this may take up to several seconds
	per key, depending on the key length and type.

	sometimes, DSA keys fail to be reconstructed:
	the dsa->pub_key member fails to reconstruct, possibly more.
	the reason is unknown, so far.

	to compile this, you will need a current openssh-version:
	in this directory, do:
		tar zxf openssh-X.Y.tar.gz
		ln -s openssh-X.Y openssh
		cd openssh
		./configure
		cd ..
		make

	this should do.
