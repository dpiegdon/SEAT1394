remote-ps.c
	this will only work on ia32 linux with a 3G userspace 1G kernelspace memory layout

	will try to find all processes on a given system that is connected via firewire.
	give the target number as argument. to find this number (0...CSR), use e.g. 1394csrtool.

snarf-sshkey.c, ssh-authfile.h
	this will only work on ia32 linux with a 3G userspace 1G kernelspace memory layout

	this will search for ssh-agent processes and dump all keys it can find in a immediately
	usable format (!).Â again, give target number of machine on firewirebus as argument. to
	find target number (0...CSR), use e.g. 1394csrtool.

	to compile this, you will need a current openssh-version:
	in this directory, do:
		tar zxf openssh-X.Y.tar.gz
		ln -s openssh-X.Y openssh
		cd openssh
		./configure
		cd ..
		make

	this should do.
