Whut?
=====

This is a timecapsule release for the "hacking in physically addressable memory" paper from ~2007.
It contains:

- the developed software
  - liblinear
  - libphysical 
  - attack tools
  - helper tools
- the original
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpiegdon/SEAT1394/refs/heads/main/paper.pdf">paper</a>
  and
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpiegdon/SEAT1394/refs/heads/main/folien.pdf">slides</a>.

Have fun. No idea if any of this still compiles... :-)
I mainly release this because I am annoyed about spam sites "publishing" the PDFs at random places.

RFC2795 FTW!
