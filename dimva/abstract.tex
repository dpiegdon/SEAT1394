\begin{abstract}

This paper introduces new advances in gaining unauthorised access to a computer
by accessing its physical memory via various means. We will show a unified
approach for using IEEE1394, also known as firewire, file descriptors and other
methods to read from and write into a victim's memory. Thereafter we will show
the power of this ability in several example attacks: stealing private SSH keys
and how to inject arbitrary code in order to obtain an interactive shell on the
victim's computer.

All of these advances are based on data structures that are required by the CPU
to provide virtual address spaces for each process running on the system.  These
data structures are searched and parsed in order to reassemble pages scattered
in physical memory, thus being able to read and write in each processes virtual
address space.

The attacks introduced in this paper are adaptable to all kinds of operating
system and hardware combinations. As a sample target, we have chosen Linux on an
IA-32 system with the kernel-options \texttt{CONFIG\_NOHIGHMEM} or
\texttt{CONFIG\_HIGHMEM4G}, \texttt{CONFIG\_VMSPLIT\_3G} and
\texttt{CONFIG\_PAGE\_OFFSET=0xC0000000}.
